# Hi, I'm Yocheved Philip ðŸ‘‹  

Computer Science student with a genuine interest in how systems and code work behind the scenes.  
Currently focusing on backend and systems programming using **Python** and **C**.  
I enjoy learning by exploring, experimenting, and understanding â€” not just making things run.

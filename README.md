# Hi, I'm Yocheved Philip

I'm a backend developer who likes to understand how things work â€” not just get them to run.

I'm currently learning C, with interest in low-level and system-oriented development.  
When I build something, it's to understand what's really happening â€” not just to make it work.

I care about code I understand, and learning through logic and practice.

### Selected Projects:

- [`seat-shade-app`](https://github.com/YochevedPhilip/seat-shade-app)  
  A backend Java server built from scratch. Calculates sun position based on time and location, and recommends the optimal shaded seat.  
  > Includes HTTP handling, geo/time logic, and clean architecture â€” no frameworks used.

- [`coupon-system-backend`](https://github.com/YochevedPhilip/coupon-system-backend) (archived)  
  A Spring Boot REST API built during my earlier backend training. Demonstrates multi-role access, basic MVC structure, and role-based logic.

---

### Technologies I use:

- **Languages**: C, Java  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux  
- **Experience with**: Spring Boot, REST APIs, OOP, SQL

---

### What I'm looking for:

To join a technical team that values logical thinking, clean code, and developers who want to understand the system from the inside out â€”  
whether itâ€™s backend development in Java or system-level programming in C.

# Hi, I'm Yocheved Philip

I'm a backend developer who likes to understand how things work â€” not just get them to run.

I'm currently learning C, with interest in low-level and system-oriented development.  
When I build something, it's to understand what's really happening â€” not just to make it work.

I care about code I understand, and learning through logic and practice.



---

### Technologies I use:

- **Languages**: C, Java  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux  
- **Experience with**: Spring Boot, REST APIs, OOP, SQL

---

### What I'm looking for:

To join a technical team that values logical thinking, clean code, and developers who want to understand the system from the inside out â€”  
whether itâ€™s backend development in Java or system-level programming in C.

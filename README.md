# Hi, I'm Yocheved Philip

I'm a backend developer who likes to understand how things really work â€” not just how to make them run.

Right now, I'm diving deep into the C programming language, with a clear goal of working in roles that involve low-level development, system-level thinking, or infrastructure work.  
At the same time, Iâ€™m working with Java and building backend servers from scratch â€” without frameworks â€” so I can fully understand what each line of code is doing.

I focus on writing code I truly understand, and on building strong technical skills through logic, structure, and steady practice.

### Selected Projects:

- [`seat-shade-app`](https://github.com/YochevedPhilip/seat-shade-app)  
  A backend Java server built from scratch. Calculates sun position based on time and location, and recommends the optimal shaded seat.  
  > Includes HTTP handling, geo/time logic, and clean architecture â€” no frameworks used.

- [`coupon-system-backend`](https://github.com/YochevedPhilip/coupon-system-backend) (archived)  
  A Spring Boot REST API built during my earlier backend training. Demonstrates multi-role access, basic MVC structure, and role-based logic.

---

### Technologies I use:

- **Languages**: C, Java  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux  
- **Experience with**: Spring Boot, REST APIs, OOP, SQL

### What I'm looking for:

To join a technical team that values logical thinking, clean code, and developers who want to understand the system from the inside out â€”  
whether itâ€™s backend development in Java or system-level programming in C.
